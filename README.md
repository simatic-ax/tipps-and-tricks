## What is this application doing?

## Install the application example and open it locally

1. Open a command line interface (CLI) and switch to the target folder like:

      ```sh
      D:
      cd \Examples
      ```

1. Install the application example and open it with `AX Code`

      Run the following commands in a CLI

      ```sh
      apax create @simatic-ax/tipps_and_tricks --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com tipps_and_tricks
      axcode tipps_and_tricks
      ```

## Setup the application example

1. Start a PLCSIM Advanced Instance or using a 1500 PLC. Download a TIA Portal created HWCN with a 1500 standard PLC (Default IP Address 192.168.0.1).

      > The default ip address can be changed in the apax.yml
>
      > ```yml
      > IP_ADDRESS: "192.168.0.1"
      > ```

1. If not open, open a terminal in AX Code (`CTRL+SHIFT+รถ`)

## Start the application example

  The application example can be started with the following command:

   ```cli
   apax start [1500]
   ```

   > `1500` is required, if you use a real 1500 PLC instead of PLCSIM Advanced.
